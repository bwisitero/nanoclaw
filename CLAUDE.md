# NanoClaw

Personal Claude assistant. See [README.md](README.md) for philosophy and setup. See [docs/REQUIREMENTS.md](docs/REQUIREMENTS.md) for architecture decisions.

## Quick Context

Single Node.js process that connects to WhatsApp, routes messages to Claude Agent SDK running in Apple Container (Linux VMs). Each group has isolated filesystem and memory.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/index.ts` | Orchestrator: state, message loop, agent invocation |
| `src/channels/whatsapp.ts` | WhatsApp connection, auth, send/receive |
| `src/ipc.ts` | IPC watcher and task processing |
| `src/router.ts` | Message formatting and outbound routing |
| `src/config.ts` | Trigger pattern, paths, intervals |
| `src/container-runner.ts` | Spawns agent containers with mounts |
| `src/task-scheduler.ts` | Runs scheduled tasks |
| `src/db.ts` | SQLite operations |
| `groups/{name}/CLAUDE.md` | Per-group memory (isolated) |
| `container/skills/agent-browser.md` | Browser automation tool (available to all agents via Bash) |

## Skills

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `/setup` | First-time installation, authentication, service configuration |
| `/customize` | Adding channels, integrations, changing behavior |
| `/debug` | Container issues, logs, troubleshooting |

## Code Comments & Decision Context

When making non-obvious decisions — especially security, performance, or architectural choices — add inline comments explaining **why**, not just what. Future sessions (including yours) will use these comments to understand constraints and avoid reverting intentional decisions.

Examples of what to document:
- Why a credential path was chosen over alternatives (e.g. STS temp creds vs mounting `~/.aws`)
- Why a guard clause or validation exists (the attack it prevents)
- Why something that looks redundant is actually necessary (e.g. both env vars AND file mounts for auth)
- Performance tradeoffs (e.g. "fs.watch + fallback poll because fs.watch alone misses events on some filesystems")

Don't over-comment obvious code. Focus on decisions that would confuse a future reader or that you'd otherwise need to re-research.

## Development

Run commands directly—don't tell the user to run them.

```bash
npm run dev          # Run with hot reload
npm run build        # Compile TypeScript
./container/build.sh # Rebuild agent container
```

Service management:
```bash
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist
```

## Container Build Cache

Apple Container's buildkit caches the build context aggressively. `--no-cache` alone does NOT invalidate COPY steps — the builder's volume retains stale files. To force a truly clean rebuild:

```bash
container builder stop && container builder rm && container builder start
./container/build.sh
```

Always verify after rebuild: `container run -i --rm --entrypoint wc nanoclaw-agent:latest -l /app/src/index.ts`
